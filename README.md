# 🔐 OS3 - Open Source Supply Chain Security Scanner

## 🚀 Overview
OS3 is a developer-first security tool designed to analyze open-source packages **before installation**.  
It helps developers identify vulnerabilities, detect fake packages, and understand attack paths in real time.

👉 Instead of reacting after installation, OS3 enables **proactive security decisions**.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
Modern development relies heavily on open-source packages.  
However:

- Developers install packages without knowing their risks  
- Existing tools analyze vulnerabilities only after installation  
- Fake or malicious packages can easily enter the system  
- No visibility into how vulnerabilities propagate through dependencies  

---

## 💡 Solution
OS3 provides **pre-installation security analysis** through:

- 🔍 Dependency analysis  
- ⚠️ Vulnerability detection  
- 🛣️ Attack path identification  
- 🧠 Security scoring system  
- 🚫 Fake package detection
